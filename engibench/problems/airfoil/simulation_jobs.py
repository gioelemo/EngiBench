    """Takes in the given configuration and designs, then runs the simulation analysis.

    Any arguments should be things that you want to change across the different jobs, and anything
    that is the same/static across the runs should just be defined inside this function.

    Args:
        problem_configuration (dict): The specific configuration used to setup the problem being passed.
            For the airfoil problem this includes Mach number, Reynolds number, and angle of attack.
        configuration_id (int): A unique identifier for the job for later debugging or tracking.
        design (list): list of lists defining x and y coordinates of airfoil geometry.

    Returns:
        "performance_dict": Dictionary of aerodynamic performance (lift & drag).
        "simulate_time": The time taken to run this simulation job. Useful for aggregating
            the time taken for dataset generation.
        "problem_configuration": Problem configuration parameters
        "configuration_id": Identifier for specific simulation configurations
