# Reviewer Checklist:

- [ ] The content of this PR brings value to the community. It is not too specific to a particular use case.
- [ ] The tests and checks pass (linting, formatting, type checking). For a new problem, double-check the GitHub actions workflow to ensure the problem is being tested.
- [ ] The documentation is updated. I can also check the [built documentation](https://github.com/IDEALLab/EngiBench/actions/workflows/docs-main.yml) to verify the HTML rendering.
- [ ] The code is understandable and commented. No large code blocks are left unexplained, no huge file. Can I read and understand the code easily?
- [ ] There is no merge conflict.
- [ ] If this PR affects an existing problem, the changes do not break the existing results (datasets, training curves, etc.). If they do, is there a good reason for it? And is the associated problem version bumped?
- [ ] For a new problem, has the dataset been generated with our SLURM script so we can re-generate it if needed? (This also ensures that the problem is running on the HPC.)
- [ ] For bugfixes, it is a robust fix and not a hacky workaround.
